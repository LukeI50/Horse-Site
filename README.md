### Accessibililty and Responsiveness



### Colour Palette

The colour palette for this project was chosen by looking at different horse coat colours.

Ultimately, we ended up chosing the colours shown below. They were picked based on the Piebald horse coat colour with some additional off-white and gray colours to fill in gaps.

### Fonts 

We started with a variety of fonts, sticking mainly to sans serif fonts for readability.

Eventually we chose __font choice__ as we felt that it maintained readability while having a professional, trustworthy look.
