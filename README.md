## UX / UI



### Accessibililty and Responsiveness



### Colour Palette

The colour palette for this project was chosen by looking at different horse coat colours.

<br>

Ultimately, we ended up chosing the colours shown below. They were picked based on the Piebald horse coat colour with some additional off-white and gray colours to fill in gaps.

### Fonts 

We started with a variety of fonts, sticking mainly to sans serif fonts for readability.

Eventually we chose __font choice__ as we felt that it maintained readability while having a professional, trustworthy look.

## Project planning 


Initial planning of the project was done using [Miro](https://miro.com). All colour palettes, wireframes and ERDs were posted there and developed over time.

Following this we created a kanban style project board on GitHub and populated it with user stories.
